				<h2>Our mission</h2>
				<p>This website is all about educating the world of the great wonders of exotic cheese. Because why not? If I didn't take my time to make a website telling everything about cheese then this sacred knowledge of much importance may die out.<br><br>I think that if the world was more educated in all things cheese, the world would be a much better place. It would be a gouda world.</p>
